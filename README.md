This repository contains a TypeScript function that accepts a string or null and returns a string. The function works correctly when called with a string or null, but throws a runtime error when called with a number because of type mismatch. The bug is that the compiler will not flag this as an error because it is type safe. However, it will cause a runtime error if the function is called with a number.  This is because the function is expecting a string or null but it is receiving a number.  The solution is to add a type guard to the function to check if the input is a number and throw an error if it is.
